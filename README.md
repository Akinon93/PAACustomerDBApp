# PAACustomerDBApp
This app is designed to be the primary app for my workplace.  Currently you can add a new customer, and edit customer information.
Next project is to incorporate the "Create new Work Orders" app into it, rewriting it, and also creating an "Edit Work Order" section.
Neither of the 2 above I plan on implementing during the interview/test, as they would require my computer to not only have Excel installed, but also company information which I have attempted to keep out of the code for this.
I do, however, have a few ideas for improvements that could be made, which I believe would be perfect for the interview/test.
